**for work you need to download data**

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender

**Context**

This database was created to identify a voice as male or female, based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in R using the seewave and tuneR packages, with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz (human vocal range).

## Required libraries:
 - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - Numpy logo. A three-dimensional blue cube with the letter 'N' highlighted in yellow.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) - a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. In particular, these are some of the core packages
